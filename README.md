# NPM Repo
Starting a repo to make deploying my NPM server easy.

# Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dustinwloring1988/docker
cd npm/docker
# If you do not have docker and dopcker compose installed run this the server will restart at the end though
install-docker.sh
# Once the server restarts then run the following to setup everthing
setup-all-containers.sh
```

TODO's:
1) Make an install script.
2) Use the ENV's in the docker compose files to make it easier to deploy the server.
3) Fix any errors that pop up.
